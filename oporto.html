        <p class="card-text">Cutting through the heart of the city, Liberdade Square recalls the grand boulevards of Paris. Flanked by stately buildings and elegant hotels, the wide street features one of the city's most recognizable landmarks, a granite town hall famous for its 70 m (230 ft) tall bell tower. The boulevard's central square, featuring the towering equestrian statue of King Peter IV, serves as the site of frequent art festivals and exhibits. Try to avoid the heavy traffic that often chokes this avenue by exploring the area on foot or by bicycle. Literary fans may want to stop by the statue of writer Almeida Garrett in front of the town hall.</p>
